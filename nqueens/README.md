# directory Nqueens by A.OTMANI
## Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.
1) function, def nqueens():
    Usage: nqueens N
        If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
2) Where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
        If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
        If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
3) The program should print every possible solution to the problem
        One solution per line
        Format: see example
        You donâ€™t have to print the solutions in a specific order
