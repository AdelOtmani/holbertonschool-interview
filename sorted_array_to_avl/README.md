# directory sorted_array_to_avl by A.OTMANI
## Write a function that slides and merges an array of integers

1) Prototype: avl_t *sorted_array_to_avl(int *array, size_t size);
2) Where array is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted
3) And size is the number of element in the array
4) Your function must return a pointer to the root node of the created AVL
    tree, or NULL on failure
5) You can assume there will be no duplicate value in the array
6) You are not allowed to rotate
7) You can only have 3 functions in your file
