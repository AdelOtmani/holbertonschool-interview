# directory heap_sort by A.OTMANI
## Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

1) Prototype: void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);
2) You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm
3) Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)

## Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

1) in the best case
2) in the average case
3) in the worst case
