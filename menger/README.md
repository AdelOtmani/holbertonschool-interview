## Write a function that draws a 2D Menger Sponge
1) Prototype: void menger(int level);
2) Where level is the level of the Menger Sponge to draw
3) If level is lower than 0, your function must do nothing
4) Youâ€™re allowed to use the math library. Your program will be compiled using the ld flag -lm

Format:
1) Here, we will only draw a 2D version of the Menger sponge, but the principle is the same
2) A level N sponge is a 3x3 square of level N-1 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
3) A level 0 sponge is represented by the # character
4) Examples:
        - A level 0 sponge is a simple 1x1 square
        - A level 1 sponge is a 3x3 square of level 0 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
        - A level 2 sponge is a 3x3 square of level 1 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
5) TIP: The size of a level N Menger sponge is calculated as follows: 3^N
