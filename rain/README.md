## Calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.
1) Prototype: def rain(walls)
2) walls is a list of non-negative integers.
3) Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
4) Assume that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after index walls[-1]) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
5) If the list is empty return 0.
